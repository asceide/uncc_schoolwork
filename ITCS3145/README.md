# ITCS3145
This is repo contains (95%) of all the assignments given to us by Dr. Qiong Cheng for ITCS 3145 (Introduction to Parallel Processing and Distributed Systems) at UNCC during Spring 2020. The only things that are missing from this are Optional Assignments, Extra Credit Assignments and the CUDA Portion of the Course Project, which was optional.

1. First Module 2A Assignments
   - Mini Project: Fundamentals in Parallel Computing - Serial Histogram.c

2. Module 3 Assignments:
   - Lab: Shared-memory Parallelism through PThreads (Part 1): Lab- Pthread Hello
   - Lab: Shared-memory Parallelism through Pthreads (Part 2): Lab- Global Sum
   - Mini Project: Shared-memory Parallelism through POSIX Threads in Calculating Pi and Histogram: Parallel Pi and Parallel Histogram
 
3. Module 4 Assignments:
   - Lab: Distributed-memory Programming via MPI (Part 1 Fundamentals): Lab- MPI Fundamentals
   - Lab: Distributed-memory Programming via MPI (Part 2 Blocking Point-to-Point Communication by MPI_Send and MPI_Recv): Lab- MPI Fundamentals
   - Lab: Distributed-memory Programming via MPI (Part 3 Basic Communication Patterns): Lab- MPI Lab 3
   - Mini Project: Distributed-Memory Parallelism through MPI: Lab- MPI Mini Project
