The results for the trapezoids from the serial program and the openmp program with 4 threads were the same. Outside of the run time in which obviously the OMP program would beat the serial program, both calculations came to the same results. However, the calculations from OMP program with 3 threads were noticably different. I imagine this is because the trapezoid was being calculated with 3 threads, which means the trapezoid was being calculated with an odd number and thus would result in a disparity between results.
